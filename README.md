# KNN_algorithm

# Project Title Name: 

Make the prediction for "iris.csv" using KNN algorithm of Machine Learning, to find the value of K for Supervised Learning Clustering.

# Project Statement:

A American based botnical garden a grow iris flower in their labs but using bio technology in a single tree different type of varitey flower is grow.

As a DataScience Engineer find out how much accuracy is their all categorys contains same spieces.

# Conclusion:

According to my KNN model the value of K=3 then my model is successfully implement
